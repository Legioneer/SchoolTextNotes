SchoolTextNotes
===============
The primary purpose of this directory is for me to become familiar with using git on a regular basis.
The secondary purpose of this is for me to mainatin my class notes locally on my machine, as well as remotely
through github. Drop box lets me access my documents from anywhere, but if I don't hava an internet connection,
then I can't. Versioning my noted through git allows me to keep my notes locally, and then when I have internet,
to update my notes repository with the latest changes to my local notes.
